The game of generators

## Ideas
I am working on making a Go game using enbitengine. I got this idea watching a fairly in-depth Nuclear game on youtube. I want to start with emulating several powersystems (nuclear, coal, hydro, and wind) and from there either make an incremental, idle, or go with the in-depth running each type. Power requiremnts vs generation, with fluctuating demand would be good.
